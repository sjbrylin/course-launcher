# course-launcher
A Python GUI that allows you to customize with your classes and any associated Zoom links, other webpage links, etc.

# Current Project
Right now, the project just opens Google Maps and has a template for opening a Zoom meeting, as a proof of concept. You'll need to modify this so that it opens the pages and/or meetings you need.

To modify your schedule, modify the buttons at the bottom of the file. Create methods for each class you need.
